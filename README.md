-c custom command to update wallpaper,```{{}}``` must be added, and it will be replaced by the path name of image.

--auto auto detect your desktop environment and use proper command to update.ignored if -d option is added.

--random random image to update wallpaper instead of using the newest one.(You should make sure ~/BingWallpaper is not empty and contains at least one image file)

--silent no notification after updating successfull.

-baseurl to specific subdomain for bing.com for accident,ignored if --random option is added. https://www.bing.com , https://www2.bing.com , https://www4.bing.com , https://cn.bing.com will be choosed automatically if you don't use this option. And this option's value must be in the above four url to avoid other unknown accident.
